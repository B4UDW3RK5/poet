               72  3a  2f  2f  74               given up to the gods of the Internet, I thought
         ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ ▄              I'd come clean about my pieces of the anonymous
 ▄▄      █     █ █     █ █     █ █▄▄▄           tapestry. I don't think there was any doubt
▀  ▀▄▄▀  █     █ █     █ █▀▀▀▀▀▀ █              ~poet was me, I'm pretty sure I even said as
         █▄▄▄▄▄█ █▄▄▄▄▄█ █▄▄▄▄▄▄ █▄▄▄▄▄▄        much at one point, but it was fun to hide behind
         █                                      the mask.

               62  6c  61  63  6b                    I think ~poet's true pièce de résistance
               2f  31  2f  75  73               was a "collaboration" on a one-shot Soft Ash
            .  65  72  73  2f  70  .            show which should have been included on the
            :  6f  65  74  00  00  :            Gopher space but I guess I never got around to 
            :....              ....:            it. If I can, I'll include it in this repository
                                                for posterity's sake. The collaboration featured
       gopher://tilde.black/1/users/poet        poetry readings, ostensibly by the enigmatic
                                                ~poet themselves.
